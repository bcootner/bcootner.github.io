	  	<h2>About me</h2>
			<p> I'm currently a computer engineering student at Boston University, and completed one semester abroad at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid in Spain. I am expected to graduate in May of 2017.</p>
			<p> I have experience with Swift, C#, C++, Java, and Verilog. I'm also familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most of my experience consists of mobile application development alongside backend web servers.</p>
		<h2>Projects</h2>
			<ul>
  			<li> Zyp LLC - Worked on Zyp's mobile iOS application; implemented several new features and successfully pushed multiple builds to the app store.</li>
			
			<li> Muliticylce CPU - Generated a virtual CPU in Verilog with an n-bit ALU, registers, state machines and multiple logic gates. </li>
			
			<li> RFID Door Lock - Worked with a teammate to create an RFID reader door lock using an MSP430 microprocessor and servomotors.</li>
			
			<li> TicTacToe - Built a Windows application that plays tic tac toe using C# and the .NET framework.</li>
			
			<li> Various iOS apps - Independently designed and published two original iOS apps (TimerTap and DigiDrag). Worked with others to create mobile apps during various Hackathons (HackBU, HackHarvard). </li>
			
			<li> This website - Coded using HTML, CSS and Javascript to get the current time, translate it into a hex color value, and set that as the webpage background color. </li>
			</ul>
